Tab-delimited File to CSV File Conversion Script
================================================

Description
-----------

    Because CONTENTdm exports files as tab-delimited files instead of standards comma-separated-value (CSV) files, it
    makes it tricky to work with. As of this writing, the makepbcore script cannot read tab-delimited files. However,
    these files can be converted into CSV using the tsv2csv utility script.

Usage
-----
    In a terminal window, type "tsv2csv" and the file name.

Example

    ::

        tsv2csv /Volumes/CAPPS-01/Headlands/Headlands_caps_export.txt
